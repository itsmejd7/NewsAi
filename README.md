## Deploying to Vercel

1. Ensure you have a Vercel account and the Vercel CLI installed.
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. This project includes `vercel.json` for a Vite SPA with proper rewrites.

3. Set environment variables in Vercel (Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables):
   - `VITE_NEWSAPI_KEY`
   - `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - (optional) `VITE_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` if you use Hugging Face on `ArticlePage`.

4. Deploy
   ```bash
   vercel
   vercel --prod
   ```

Vercel will run `npm run build` and serve the `dist` output. Client-side routing is handled by a SPA rewrite to `index.html`.
